# Software_Robot_Training_Homework_2019-20

Submit your training homework to your folder here.

Please create your folder first and submit ONLY the .java file into your folder.

You will HAVE to create pull requests on **EVERY ASSIGNMENT** (but commiting every time you change your code) you submit an assignment to practice using GitHub, but only create **one** branch so that the repo doesn't get messy.

You will need at least one review from a **classmate** before you can merge and submit your homework.

If you don't know how to do something, **ASK**! We don't expect you to know how all this works when you finish general programming training.
